# Product Mission

## Pitch
Dojogram is an AI-powered Instagram carousel maker that helps AI/automation teams create on-brand, high-quality carousel posts faster
by generating a full multi-slide carousel (images + copy) from a theme and a reference post style, with iterative edits via natural language.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- AI/Automation Agency Teams: Content and marketing teams producing educational/promotional carousels for products and courses.

### User Personas
**Agency Content Strategist** (25–40)
- **Role:** Plans content themes and outlines weekly posts
- **Context:** Small, high-output team shipping content across multiple accounts
- **Pain Points:** Carousels take too long to design; style consistency is hard; iteration loops are slow
- **Goals:** Produce more posts per week with consistent style and quick revisions

**Creative Operator** (22–35)
- **Role:** Turns outlines into polished carousel slides
- **Context:** Juggles multiple accounts and needs reusable patterns
- **Pain Points:** Manual layout work; copy/design back-and-forth; exporting the right formats repeatedly
- **Goals:** Generate, refine, and export carousels with minimal friction

## The Problem

### High-effort carousel creation
Instagram carousels are time-consuming to design and write, especially when output quality must be consistently high across accounts. This reduces publishing velocity and makes iteration expensive.

**Our Solution:** Generate complete, editable carousels from a theme and one or more reference posts (style inspiration), then allow fast iteration using natural language and per-slide controls.

## Differentiators

### Reference-style generation
Unlike generic “template” tools, we generate new carousels that closely match the layout, typography, color palette, and illustration style of a provided reference post.
This results in faster, consistent output that looks intentionally designed.

### Natural-language iteration
Unlike editors that require manual pixel-pushing, we enable users to revise slides with plain-language instructions (e.g., “make the hook stronger”, “use fewer words on slide 3”, “swap the illustration style to match the reference more closely”).
This results in faster review cycles and less creative friction.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **Reference-style mimic:** Provide one or more Instagram carousel references (URL/images) to inspire layout, colors, typography, and visual style.
- **Editable per-slide output:** Adjust text, layout, and visuals for individual slides and regenerate selectively without starting over.

### Collaboration Features
- **Multi-account management:** Manage and organize multiple Instagram accounts under one user/workspace.
- **History & reuse:** Save generated carousels, versions, and style presets for quick reuse across future posts.

### Advanced Features
