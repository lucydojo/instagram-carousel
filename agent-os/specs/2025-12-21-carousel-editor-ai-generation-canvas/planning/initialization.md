# Spec Initialization

## Raw idea (unmodified)
This spec covers the end-to-end “studio” experience for Dojogram: a canvas-based carousel editor with AI-powered generation (text + images), guided by optimization options/presets/templates, plus natural-language editing with element locking.

See `planning/raw-idea.md` for the original raw description captured during shaping.
