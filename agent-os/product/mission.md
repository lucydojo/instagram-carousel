# Product Mission

## Pitch
Dojogram is an AI-powered carousel design studio that helps AI/automation teams create stunning Instagram carousel posts by generating complete multi-slide carousels (images + copy) from a prompt, optional reference style, and structured “optimization options”, with a canvas-like editor for iterative refinement — reducing hours of manual work to minutes.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **Internal AI/Automation Agency Team**: Marketing and content professionals creating educational and promotional carousels for AI productivity products and courses.

### User Personas
**Agency Content Strategist** (25-40)
- **Role:** Plans content themes and outlines weekly posts for multiple accounts
- **Context:** Small, high-output team at an AI/automation agency selling products and courses about AI productivity
- **Pain Points:** Carousels take too long to design; style consistency is hard; iteration loops are slow; managing multiple Instagram accounts is cumbersome
- **Goals:** Produce more posts per week with consistent style, quick revisions, and scheduled publishing across multiple accounts

**Creative Operator** (22-35)
- **Role:** Turns content outlines into polished carousel slides
- **Context:** Juggles multiple Instagram accounts and needs reusable design patterns
- **Pain Points:** Manual layout work; copy and design back-and-forth; exporting files and manually uploading to Instagram repeatedly
- **Goals:** Generate, refine, and publish carousels with minimal friction - no downloads, no manual uploads

## The Problem

### High-Effort Carousel Creation and Manual Publishing
Instagram carousels are time-consuming to design and write, especially when output quality must be consistently high across multiple accounts. The process involves coordinating design tools, writing copy, ensuring visual consistency, downloading files, and manually uploading to Instagram. This reduces publishing velocity, makes iteration expensive, and creates workflow bottlenecks.

**Our Solution:** Generate complete, editable carousels from a theme (and optional reference style inspiration), guide generation with structured optimization options (platform, tone, audience, language, presets), and let users refine output in a canvas-like editor with selectable elements and natural-language changes.

## Differentiators

### AI-Powered Style Replication
Unlike generic template tools or basic AI generators, we generate new carousels that closely match the layout, typography, color palette, and visual style of provided reference Instagram posts. This results in faster, consistent output that looks intentionally designed and maintains brand coherence.

### Natural Language Iteration
Unlike traditional editors that require manual pixel-pushing and text rewriting, we enable users to revise slides with plain-language instructions (e.g., "make the hook stronger", "use fewer words on slide 3", "make colors more vibrant"). This results in faster review cycles and less creative friction.

### Direct Instagram Publishing Without Downloads
Unlike content creation tools that require downloading files and manual Instagram uploads, we provide seamless direct publishing to multiple connected Instagram accounts with scheduling capabilities. This results in a streamlined workflow that eliminates file management and manual posting steps entirely.
